# Predicting-Student-Depression-Using-Machine-Learning-A-Comparative-Study-of-Classification-Models
This project investigates the application of various Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a student experiences depression, based on behavioral, academic, and psychological indicators. Each model was evaluated both with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the impact of dimensionality reduction on performance. The dataset was preprocessed through column filtering, handling missing values via imputation, label encoding, and feature scaling. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Among all models, SVM and Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy, indicating a predominantly linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
